# CSE 112: The Desire

We were given **4 tasks** to solve in our first OOP Lab Evaluation on the **8th of July**. Since I had some programming knowledge, I could complete them before everyone else. Our lecturer noticed it and immediately asked me to **find the 2nd and 3rd largest numbers from an Array of numbers**. My first attempt was done with conditionals and two extra variables.

Then he asked whether there was any efficient way to **find the N-th largest number from an Array**. Which I answered- **yes**. It was done via a separate function and a global array. The teacher was impressed and kind enough to spot an edge case where my solution could break. For the final task, he asked me to demonstrate a sorting algorithm. I presented my favorite sorting algorithm, which was [**selection sort**][1].

This incident inspired me to seek creative solutions for such practice problems. Clearly, [**sorting could solve the problem**][2], but it was the **desire** that pushed me to consider an alternative solution.

> On August 1st, 2024, our CSE lecturer **Md. Mushfiqul Haque Omi (MHO)** resigned and a new CSE lecturer named **Nabliha Khandker (NAB)** was appointed to take his position. We, the students of section 9, wish **Mushfiqul sir** the best in his future endeavors. I will continue to update this repository, hopefully to present it to our current CSE lecturer.

> **Original:** This repository is a compilcation of the tasks assigned by our CSE lecturer, **Md. Mushfiqul Haque Omi (MHO)**. His charisma inspired me and 39 other students to become better programmers during the second semester of **Intake 53**.

**Duration:** 2 months 22 days (**from 8 Jul 2024 to 28 Sep 2024**)

**Problems Solved:** 69
