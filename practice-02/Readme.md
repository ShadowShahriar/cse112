# Practice 2: Competitive Programming

During my first semester, I tried solving competitive programming problems on [**CodeForces**][0].

This time, I'm trying to familiarize myself with [**Toph**][1], an online Competitive Programming platform by [**Furqan Software**][2]. My goal is to solve as many problems as possible and identify patterns. As usual, I began from the very basics. Here are the problems I have solved so far:

**Note:** Interesting problems are marked with a star (⭐)
