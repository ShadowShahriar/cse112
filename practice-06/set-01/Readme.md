# Question Paper 1

## 1. Write down the answers.

### **(a).** What is Access Modifier in Object Oriented Programming?

**Ans.:** Access modifiers (or access specifiers) are **keywords** in object-oriented programming languages that set the accessibility of **classes**, **methods**, and **other members**. Access modifiers are a specific part of programming language syntax used to facilitate the **encapsulation** of components.

In C++, there are **three** access modifiers:

1. **Public**: All the class members declared under the **public** access modifier will be available to everyone.

2. **Private**: The class members declared as **private** can be accessed only by the member functions inside the class. Only the member functions or the **friend functions/classes** are allowed to access the private data members of the class.

3. **Protected:** The **protected** access modifier is similar to the private access modifier in the sense that it canâ€™t be accessed outside of its class unless with the help of a **friend class**. The difference is that the class members declared as **protected** can be accessed by any subclass (derived class) of that class as well.

### **(b).** Write down the differences between Constructor and Destructor.

**Ans.:** Here are the differences between Constructor and Destructor:

| Constructor                                                                       | Destructor                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Constructor is a member function that has the same name as the name of the class. | Destructors are typically used to deallocate memory.                               |
| When the object is created, a constructor is called automatically.                | When the program gets terminated, the destructor is called automatically.          |
| A constructor allows an object to initialize some of its value before it is used. | A destructor allows an object to execute some code at the time of its destruction. |
| There can be various constructors in a class                                      | There is constantly a single destructor in the class                               |
| Can be overloaded.                                                                | Cannot be overloaded.                                                              |
| Receives arguments.                                                               | Does not receive any argument.                                                     |

## 2. Explain Union in C++ with a suitable example.

**Ans.:** In C++, a union is a **user-defined data type** in which we can define members of different data types just like structures. The the member variables in a union share the same memory location. The size of the union is equal to the size of the largest data type.

A union can be used to achieve memory efficiency when the available memory is limited. It is used to encapsulate different types of data members.

Here is a suitable example that demonstrates the use of a union:

```CPP
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

union student
{
	int sid;
	float cgpa;
};

int main()
{
	union student std1;

	std1.sid = 408;
	cout << &std1.sid << endl;

	std1.cgpa = 4.86;
	cout << &std1.cgpa << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

We know that the members of the union share the same memory location. So, if we print their memory addresses, they will be the same.

```CPP
	cout << &std1.sid << endl; // 0x5219ffbdc
	cout << &std1.cgpa << endl; // 0x5219ffbdc
```

## 3. Create a C++ program that defines a class Student with the following private data members: name, roll, and marks in three subjects. The class should have the following public member functions:

-   **setDetails()**: This method takes tthe student's name, roll, and marks for three subjects as parameters, and sets them to the respective data members.

-   **getTotalMarks()**: This method returns the total marks obtained by the student.

-   **getAverageMarks()**: This method returns the average of the student's marks.

-   **display()**: This method displays the student's name, roll, total marks and average marks.

In the `main()` function, create an object of the `Student` class, set the student's details, and display their details including the total and average marks.

**Ans.:** Here is a sample C++ program that satisfies the conditions above:

```CPP
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student
{
private:
	string name;
	int roll;
	float marks[3];

public:
	void setDetails(string n, int r, float m[3])
	{
		name = n;
		roll = r;
		marks[0] = m[0];
		marks[1] = m[1];
		marks[2] = m[2];
	}

	float getTotalMarks()
	{
		return marks[0] + marks[1] + marks[2];
	}

	float getAverageMarks()
	{
		return getTotalMarks() / 3;
	}

	void display()
	{
		cout << "Name         : " << name << endl;
		cout << "Roll No.     : " << roll << endl;
		cout << "Total Marks  : " << getTotalMarks() << endl;
		cout << "Average Marks: " << getAverageMarks() << endl;
	}
};

int main()
{
	Student std1;
	float marks[3] = {96.25, 56.00, 77.75};
	std1.setDetails("Shahriar", 408, marks);
	std1.display();
}
```
