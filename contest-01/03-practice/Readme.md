# BIUPC Warm-up Practice

My teammates and I decided to warm up our coding skills by practicing some of the older contest problems on **CodeForces**. Here are the problems we tried to solve:

-   [**96A. Football**](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/96/A)
-   [**1517A. Sum of 2050**](https://codeforces.com/contest/1517/problem/A)
-   [**4A. Watermelon**](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A)
-   [**1514A. Perfectly Imperfect Array**](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1514/A)
