# Assignment 1

## 1. Create a class named `Product`

-   It should have the following three **private** attributes: `productName` (**string**), `price` (**float**), `quantity` (**int**).

-   In the `main()` function, create a 2D Array of `Product` objects representing a 2Ã—2 grid in a shop (2 shelves with 2 products each). Initialize all `Product` object with values.

-   Then, write a method to display the details of each product in the 2D Array. Make sure the display output is formatted neatly.

**Ans.** Here is the C++ program of a class named `Product` that satisfies the conditions above:

```CPP
/**
 * ======================
 * Name: Shadman Shahriar
 * ID  : 20245013408
 * ======================
 */

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Product
{
	string productName;
	float price;
	int quantity;

public:
	Product(string n, float p, int q)
	{
		productName = n;
		price = p;
		quantity = q;
	}

	void display(int i)
	{
		cout << i << endl;
		cout << "Product : " << productName << endl;
		cout << "Price   : " << price << "/=" << endl;
		cout << "Quantity: " << quantity << endl;
		cout << endl;
	}
};

int main()
{
	const int row = 2;
	const int column = 2;
	Product shop[row][column] = {
		{Product("Toast Biscuit", 110, 2), Product("Soap", 50, 4)},
		{Product("Shampoo", 180, 1), Product("Kitkat", 105, 1)}};

	for (int r = 0; r < row; r++)
		for (int c = 0; c < column; c++)
			shop[r][c].display((c + 1) + (row * r));

	return 0;
}
```

## 2. Create a class named `Book`

-   It should have **private** attributes: `title` (**string**), `author` (**string**), `pages` (**int**).

-   Write a function `assignBook()` that assigns values to a `Book` object. Also, write another function `displayBook()` to display its details.

-   Next, create a function named `compareBooks()`, **outside the class**, that takes two `Book` object as pointers and returns the one with more pages.
    -   Use `assignBook()` to initialize two `Book` object.
    -   Use `compareBooks()` to find and **display the book** with the higher page count.

**Hint:** Focus on using _object pointers_ when passing the objects to the functions (Here, `pages` is a **private** member, then what do you need to access it from outside the class?)

**Ans.** Here is the C++ program of a class named `Book` that satisfies the conditions above:

```CPP
/**
 * ======================
 * Name: Shadman Shahriar
 * ID  : 20245013408
 * ======================
 */

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Book
{
	string title;
	string author;
	int pages;

public:
	void assignBook(string t, string a, int p)
	{
		title = t;
		author = a;
		pages = p;
	}

	void displayBook()
	{
		cout << "Name  :  " << title << endl;
		cout << "Author:  " << author << endl;
		cout << "Pages :  " << pages << endl;
	}

	int getPages()
	{
		return pages;
	}
};

Book *compareBooks(Book *b1, Book *b2)
{
	if (b1->getPages() > b2->getPages())
		return b1;
	else
		return b2;
}

int main()
{
	Book book1, book2;
	book1.assignBook("Atomic Habits", "James Clear", 320);
	book2.assignBook("Show Your Work!", "Austin Kleon", 224);

	cout << "Book 1:" << endl;
	book1.displayBook();

	cout << endl;
	cout << "Book 2:" << endl;
	book2.displayBook();

	Book *bookMaxPage = compareBooks(&book1, &book2);

	cout << endl;
	cout << "Book with more pages:" << endl;
	bookMaxPage->displayBook();
	return 0;
}
```

## 3. Design two classes `Rectangle` and `Square`

-   Both classes should have **private** data members for their dimensions (**length** and **width** for `Rectangle`, **side** for `Square`)

-   Create a **friend function** named `printArea()` that takes both a `Rectangle` object and a `Square` object and prints their areas.

-   Create another **friend function** named `increaseSide()` that is a member function of `Square` and a friend of `Rectangle`. This function should increase the **side** length of the `Square` object by the value of the `Rectangle`'s **length**.

-   In the `main()` function, create objects for both `Rectangle` and `Square`, initialize them, and demonstrate the use of both **friend functions**.

**Ans.** Here is a C++ program with two classes named `Rectangle` and `Square` that follows the conditions above:

```CPP
/**
 * ======================
 * Name: Shadman Shahriar
 * ID  : 20245013408
 * ======================
 */

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle;
class Square
{
	int side;

public:
	Square(int s) : side(s) {}
	friend void printArea(Rectangle rect, Square sq);
	void increaseSide(Rectangle &rect);
};

class Rectangle
{
	int length;
	int width;

public:
	Rectangle(int l, int w) : length(l), width(w) {}
	friend void printArea(Rectangle rect, Square sq);
	friend void Square::increaseSide(Rectangle &rect);
};

void Square::increaseSide(Rectangle &rect)
{
	side += rect.length;
}

void printArea(Rectangle rect, Square sq)
{
	int areaRect = rect.length * rect.width;
	int areaSq = sq.side * sq.side;

	cout << "Rectangle: " << areaRect << " sq units" << endl;
	cout << "Square:    " << areaSq << " sq units" << endl;
}

int main()
{
	Rectangle rect(10, 20);
	Square sq(15);

	cout << "Area before increasing side length:" << endl;
	printArea(rect, sq);

	cout << endl;
	cout << "Area after increasing side length:" << endl;
	sq.increaseSide(rect);
	printArea(rect, sq);
}
```

## 4. Write the basic differences and similarities between Class, Structure and Union.

**Ans.** Here are the differences and similarities between **Class**, **Structure**, and **Union** in C++:

|                            | Class                                                                                | Structure                                                                                | Union                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Keyword**                | It is declared using the **class** keyword.                                          | It is declared using the **struct** keyword.                                             | It is declared using the **union** keyword.                                     |
| **Use Case**               | It is normally used for data abstraction and inheritance.                            | It is normally used for the grouping of different datatypes.                             | It is used to achieve memory efficiency when the available memory is limited.   |
| **Accessing&nbsp;Members** | Members of a class are **private** by default.                                       | Members of a structure are **public** by default.                                        | Member variables of a union are **public** by default.                          |
| **Size**                   | Theoritically, the size of a class can be up to 2 to the power of 55. (2^55)         | The size of a structure is the sum of the size of its data members.                      | The size of a union is equal to the size of the largest data type.              |
| **Memory&nbsp;Allocation** | It can store multiple values of the various members.                                 | Same as Class.                                                                           | It stores one value at a time for all of its members.                           |
| **Value&nbsp;Altering**    | Altering the values of a single member does not affect the other members of a Class. | Altering the values of a single member does not affect the other members of a Structure. | Altering the values of a single member, it affects the values of other members. |
| **Initialization**         | We can initialize multiple members at the same time.                                 | Same as Class.                                                                           | We can only initiate the first member at a time.                                |
